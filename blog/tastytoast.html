    </div>

    <div class="jumbotron" style="background: #F3E5F5;">
        <p>Today I am sharing my experience about how I made my first Android Library <code>TastyToast</code> . (For all
            those who are unaware about it just have a quick look at it <a
                    href="https://github.com/yadav-rahul/TastyToast" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, just grab a mug of Espresso or a big bucket of Popcorn and make yourself comfortable.</p>

        <p>So let's rotate our clock in anticlockwise direction and hop over to the month of July. Though the
            registration for academic session was beginning from 15 but I had to come Roorkee
            on 12 (after enjoying two month long Summer vacations at home) because of some academic stuff. I had no idea
            about my stay in those three days but thanks to <a href="https://github.com/raghav">Raghav</a> sir for doing
            all prior engagements in advance.</p>

        <p>Having heard a lot about the time taken by Governmental procedure for getting some work done, I made a rough
            estimate of three days at extreme to get my work done but
            my joy had no bounds when I saw it getting completed in just six hours. So What's next! I had two complete
            vacant days with no burden of those adamantine questions from those really annoying tutorials. So I took out
            my
            paper and pen and made a schedule of how to spend upcoming 48 hours of my life.</p>

        <p>First day went quite well. I married my Dell's fifth generation portable machine and went imperceptible for
            that
            day. On second day while I was just goofing around <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">Hacker
                News</a>,
            I came across various Android libraries whose purpose in life was to customize the default android widgets.
            Having a colossal interest in Android, I went through few of them and got some fragmented
            knowledge of Android Libraries and how to make
            them.
        </p>
        <p>Feeling famish after skipping breakfast, I hurried to mess for grasping lunch. While I was swallowing not so
            luscious <i>Bhindi masala</i> with couple of unmannerly cooked <i>Chapati</i>, I saw the guy sitting next to
            me who was downloading some music files from his <code>htc</code> gadget. Being a keen observer, I noticed
            that irrespective of whether downloading gets failed or succeed, same kind of Toast was appearing
            every-time. I felt quite odd about the way Android deals with the context of Toasts (though I had used same
            Toast innumerable number of time while developing! ). That was the very moment when I decided to
            customise default Android Toasts. I left my lunch unfinished and rushed to my room where my virtual portable
            wife was waiting for me to wake her up from sleep mode. By the end of day, I learned about the way Toast
            work in Android and was able to customise native Toast's background and text color.
        </p>
        <p>Next day i.e. 15, was the day of registration for next Academic session. After getting rid of all
            formalities, I started working on TastyToast ( meanwhile I forgot to mention about the name
            <code>TastyToast</code>, I named it as just because of the fact that I got this idea while I was eating in
            mess! ). After making a simple demo app, I went to my friend's room (<a
                    href="https://github.com/harshit211997" target="_blank"> harshit</a> : who is also a contributor in
            it ) and discussed my work with him.
        </p>
        <p>Harshit ( who is a typical astute guy ) showed me that their are already bunch of repositories on Github
            who are born to customise color of Toast and nothing else. I was sad seeing the fact that
            someone had already implemented an idea which was ( being an Android Developer ) was unknown to me couple of
            days before. I was feeling very fagged after this. After having a cordial sleep for couple of hours, I woke
            up and searched almost all repositories available on <a href="https://www.github.com/">Github</a>
            related to Toast. After spending four long hours, I got an idea of what people had done previously. I also
            made my decision regarding what to be done in <code>TastyToast</code>.</p>

        <p>Next was 16 (Saturday), so I had whole day to work upon my idea. I had decided to show some custom view
            (depending on the context of toast)
            on left side and the toast message on the right side of Toast. I made a new Project and started working on
            the first type i.e. <i>successToast</i>. I made my first commit on 17 (Sunday) and completed it by 21.</p>

        <p>I made my repo public on 22 and got great ovation from other members of <a href="https://mobile.sdslabs.co/">Mobile
            Development Group</a> ( I forgot to mention that I am an active member of this group for the past one year),
            I felt more energetic after that and had decided to complete other four types within one weak.</p>

        <p>I managed to complete my app by 28. It was 29 when I finally converted my work to an Android library so that
            instead of writing some big chunk of code, any geek around the world can use it by just writing one <i>include</i>
            statement.</p>

        <p>Next major task which was lying in front of me was to let the world know that their is something called
            <code>TastyToast</code>. I didn't felt much strain in that part because of some nimble peoples like <a
                    href="https://github.com/axay" target="_blank">Akshay</a>, <a
                    href="https://github.com/abhisheksachdeva/" target="_blank">Abhishek</a> and
            <a href="https://github.com/karandesai-96" target="_blank">Karan</a> sir, who not only helped
            me throughout but also informed me about the repositories like <a
                    href="https://github.com/wasabeef/awesome-android-ui" target="_blank">awesome-android</a>.
        </p>
        <p>After all it was wonderful experience for me and learned a lot throughout this process.</p>

        <p>P.S: The reason for which I wrote this blog today is because of the face that today only <a href="https://github.com/yadav-rahul/TastyToast"
                                                              target="_blank"><code>TastyToast</code> </a> has crossed
            the <i><b>1000</b></i> stars benchmark.</p>
